This tool can encode and decode messages hidden in similar pixels in image files. This can be used to hide data in communications, or as a tool for some CTF challenges.

## Usage:
python3 image_stego.py

## Notes:
Automatic mode is finnicky. It works best in files in which a large percentage of the usable pixels (those in range) have data encrypted in them.
